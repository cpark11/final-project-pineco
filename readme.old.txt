Final App Description - Flickrtron
Candace Park and Eric Xie


General Description of App:
Our app uses geolocation to show a user all the Flickr images that have been taken at that location. It also allows the user to take a picture, add a caption and post to Flickr with a location tag so that the newly taken picture can be seen on the feed for that location. 


Wireframe Explanation:
The wireframe details the four activities of our app. The first activity is a login page where the user will log into their Flickr account. The user must have a Flickr account in order to be able to use the app. 


The second activity is the photo feed, initially showing recent Flickr photos that have been geotagged near the user’s current location. There is a search bar at the top of the screen to allow the user to type in the location they want to see photos from. Alternatively the user can tap the location icon to query with the current GPS location. GPS access permission must be allowed for this feature to work. The feed would then load the Flickr images taken around that location along with any captions associated with the image. From this screen, the user can tap "log out" on the top right to log out and return to the login screen. There is a small camera button on the bottom right corner of the screen that the user can tap to take a picture to upload to Flickr. After the user taps the camera button, the device’s native camera application will open up. Once the user takes a picture, the user will be redirected back to the app at activity 3. 


The third activity is a caption screen where the user can add a caption, select a location and change the viewing privacy of the photo. The user will then be able to upload the picture onto Flickr using the large blue “UPLOAD” button at the bottom of this screen. After selecting the upload button the user will be directed back to the feed page, which is refreshed to show the latest photos.
